# Testing Birthday Buzz iOS App

## 🧪 How to Test the Experience

Since this is an iOS SwiftUI app, you'll need to run it on macOS with Xcode or use cloud-based development tools.

### Option 1: Xcode (Recommended)
1. **Transfer to Mac**: Copy the project folder to a Mac with Xcode 15+
2. **Open in Xcode**: 
   - Create new iOS App project in Xcode
   - Replace the default files with our structure
   - Set iOS deployment target to 16.0+
3. **Run**: Build and run in iOS Simulator or on device

### Option 2: Cloud Development (Windows/Web)
- **GitHub Codespaces**: Upload to GitHub and use Codespaces with iOS development
- **Replit**: Use Replit's iOS Swift environment
- **CodeSandbox**: Try their iOS Swift support

## 📱 Expected Testing Flow

### 1. Onboarding Experience
- **Step 1**: Welcome screen with blue gradient and party popper icon
- **Step 2**: Privacy screen with green gradient and shield icon  
- **Step 3**: Permission screen with orange gradient and people icon
- **Navigation**: Previous/Next buttons with smooth slide transitions
- **Final Step**: "Get Started" button with loading spinner

### 2. Triage Experience  
- **Loading**: 1-second simulated delay with spinner
- **Cards**: Stack of contact cards showing Alice, Bob, Carol, etc.
- **Swipe Right**: Green "INCLUDE" overlay appears, card animates off screen
- **Swipe Left**: Red "SKIP" overlay appears, card animates off screen
- **Buttons**: Skip (red) and Include (green) buttons at bottom
- **Progress**: Linear progress bar showing "X of 8"

### 3. Mock Data Flow
```
👤 Alice Johnson (has birthday)
👤 Bob Smith (no birthday)  
👤 Carol Davis (has birthday)
👤 David Wilson (no birthday)
👤 Emily Brown (has birthday)
👤 Frank Miller (no birthday)
👤 Grace Lee (has birthday)  
👤 Henry Taylor (no birthday)
```

### 4. Console Output
Watch for these logs during testing:
```
📱 Contacts permission granted (simulated)
✅ Including contact: Alice Johnson
⏭️ Skipping contact: Bob Smith
🎉 Triage completed!
```

## 🎯 Key UX Elements to Test

### Animations
- [ ] Smooth step transitions in onboarding
- [ ] Card depth effect (3 stacked cards visible)
- [ ] Spring animations on swipe gestures
- [ ] Card rotation and scaling during drag
- [ ] Smooth exit animations when cards dismissed

### Interactions
- [ ] Swipe right/left gesture recognition
- [ ] Button tap animations (scale effect)
- [ ] Velocity-based swipe detection
- [ ] Progress indicator updates
- [ ] Completion screen appears after 8th contact

### Visual Feedback
- [ ] Green/red overlays during swipes
- [ ] Button scaling when swiped toward
- [ ] Color-coded birthday status badges
- [ ] Avatar initials generation from names
- [ ] Loading states and transitions

## 🐛 Known Limitations (TODOs)
- Mock data only (no real contacts integration)
- No persistence (contacts don't save to storage)
- Simulated permissions (always grants access)
- No buzz list view connection yet
- Missing notification scheduling

## 🚀 Next Steps After Testing
1. Connect to real ContactService
2. Implement StorageService persistence  
3. Add BuzzListView to see selected contacts
4. Wire up notification scheduling
5. Add proper error handling
